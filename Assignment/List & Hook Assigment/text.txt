****************LIST AND HOOKS ASSIGNMENT*****************
1.Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with Hooks?
Ans. A React component undergoes three different phases in its lifecycle, including mounting, updating, and unmounting. Each phase has specific methods responsible for a particular stage in a component's lifecycle. These methods are technically particular to class based components and not intended for functional component.
However, since the concept of Hooks was released in React, you can now use abstracted versions of these lifecycle methods when you’re working with functional component state. Simply put, React Hooks are functions that allow you to “hook into” a React state and the lifecycle features within function components.
In this post, you'll learn more about the React component lifecycle and the different methods within each phase (for class-based components), focusing particularly on methods and hooks.
Here are the lifecycle methods of a class component:-
